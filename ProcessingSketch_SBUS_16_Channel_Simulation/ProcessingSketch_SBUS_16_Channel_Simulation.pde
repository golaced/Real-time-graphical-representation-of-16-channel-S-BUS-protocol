// In this examples we used an Frysky X8R and X4R receiver which was bound to a Frysky Taranis Plus
// Graphical represetentation of Futuba SBUS - also used in FrySky Receivers 
// Example by Colin Bacon
// ROBOTmaker
// www.robotmaker.eu


//To get this to work you'll need to have SBUS conneted receiver that is connected via an Arduiono or  FTDI USB thingy to your PC
//As the SBUS is an inverted signal (yes - to make life even more fun), you'll need to invert the signal using a simple transitor+2 restistors or if you have an FTDI there is a program to invert the signals automatically
//Further detail of how to do this are on our website
//Special thanks goes to Futaba for making this SBUS protocol so challenging for everyone. 
//We are convinced there are very good reasons for designing the S-BUS in this way. We however often asked our selves "why make things simple if we can make things extermely difficult..."
